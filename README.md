# My Web Development Journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Bootcamp

This repository includes all the projects I'm building as I go through

I've always wanted to learn how to build websites and real-world web applications, and this course is helping me do that step by step. I'm keeping everything organized by section so I can clearly track my progress and see how much I've grown over time.
